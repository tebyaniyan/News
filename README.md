In this program, a database of visualization studios, SqlExpress, has been used. This is how the table is designed in this database, which includes the headline of the news and a link to the site where the news is published.
By accessing the database, this source will enter the links of reputable sites you know and have a link to the news on your application.
 The project consists of a page that lists the latest news, and this list is made up of a news link that we entered in the database. Clicking on any news will open the site where the news is related.
